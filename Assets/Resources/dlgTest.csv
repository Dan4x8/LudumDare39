John Doe;Hey there!\nI'm fancy, you not!
Betty Hammond;Why you're talking to me?\n<b>Get lost!</b>
Nevi Mind; Soon . . .
Dick;<b>Phew!</b>\nIt was only a dream...
Dick;<b>Great!</b>\nIt's 03:00. Not the time to be awake...
Dick;I feel tired.\nBut I can't sleep right now.\n\nAnd I'm still shaking from the dream.
Dick;The city is still asleep...
Dick;I should go to school now.
Dick;School will start any minute.\nThey'll surely throw stuff at me again.\n\nProbably I can dodge them with left/right.
Dick;School is over.\nThey hit me only \v[hits] times.\n\nNow I have to do some shopping...
Dick;I hate this place.\nThey don't have anything good and it's the only market around...\n\nGuess I have to do some shopping now
Dick;It's not what I need...
Dick;It's also not what I need...
Dick;Nope...
Dick;Not today...
Dick;Why would I buy this?
Dick;I don't like that.
Dick;I don't even know what this is...
Dick;This looks disgusting...
Dick;Probably this?\No...I'm allergic to that.
Dick;Oh, there's the milk.
Dick;. . .
Dick;Of course this had to happen.\nThis happens only to me.\n<b>All the time!</b>
Dick;<b>Rain!</b>\nIt just had to be!\n\nI don't even have an umbrella with me...
Emily;Hey there! I'm <i>Emily</i> and I've seen you a few times around here. What's your name?\nDo you have an umbrella? If not, you could share mine.
