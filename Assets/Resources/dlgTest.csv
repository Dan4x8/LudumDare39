John Doe;Hey there!\nI'm fancy, you not!
Betty Hammond;Why you're talking to me?\n<b>Get lost!</b>
Nevi Mind; Soon . . .
Player;<b>Phew!</b>\nIt was only a dream...
Player;<b>Great!</b>\nIt's 03:00. Not the time to be awake...
Player;I feel tired.\nBut I can't sleep right now.\n\nAnd I'm still shaking from the dream.
Player;The city is still asleep...
Player;I should go to school now.
Player;School will start any minute.\nThey'll surely throw stuff at me again.\n\nProbably I can dodge them with left/right.
Player;School is over.\nThey hit me only \v[hits] times.\n\nNow I have to do some shopping...
Player;I hate this place.\nThey don't have anything good and it's the only market around...\n\nGuess I have to do some shopping now
Player;It's not what I need...
Player;It's also not what I need...
Player;Nope...
Player;Not today...
Player;Why would I buy this?
Player;I don't like that.
Player;I don't even know what this is...
Player;This looks disgusting...
Player;Probably this?\No...I'm allergic to that.
Player;Oh, there's the milk.
Player;. . .
Player;Of course this had to happen.\nThis happens only to me.\n<b>All the time!</b>
