John Doe;Hey there!\nI'm fancy, you not!
Betty Hammond;Why you're talking to me?\n<b>Get lost!</b>
Nevi Mind; Soon . . .
Player;<b>Phew!</b>\nIt was only a dream...
Player;<b>Great!</b>\nIt's 03:00. Not the time to be awake...
Player;I feel tired.\nBut I can't sleep right now.\n\nAnd I'm still shaking from the dream.
Player;The city is still asleep...
Player;I should go to school now.
Player;School will start any minute.\nThey'll surely throw stuff at me again.\n\nProbably I can dodge them with left/right.
Player;School is over.\nThey hit me only \v[hits] times.\n\nNow I have to do some shopping...
